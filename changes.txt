Changed ORG of Color BASIC to $DF00

Change memory detection routine to set end of RAM at $DF00.

Changed the MEM variable to be unsigned.

Commented out LA06E to LA070. This removes some NOPs and _doesn't_ set hi speed access for ROM mode.

Removed RAMSIZE check.

Removed Microsoft Easter Egg. And additional "Microsoft" text after floating point constants.

Added small RAM resident reset code to put SAM in RAM mode.

Removed RAM vector trampolines.

Put correct opcode back in LINHDR-1

Put label in for USRJMP in USR token jump table.

Removed unused MICROSOFT at end of Color BASIC message.

Change CLEAR to have an unsigned first argument.

Corrected operator precedence table to refer to the labels rather than the ROM offsets.
