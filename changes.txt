Changed ORG of Color BASIC to $DF00

Modified startup routine to not change last 3 sam registers. This will keep the CoCo in All RAM mode.

Change memory detection routine to set end of RAM at $DF00.

Changed the MEM variable to be unsigned.

Commented out LA06E to LA070. This removes some NOPs and _doesn't_ set hi speed access for ROM mode.

Removed RAMSIZE check.
